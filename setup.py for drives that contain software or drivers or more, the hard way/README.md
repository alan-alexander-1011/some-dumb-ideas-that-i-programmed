# This is setup.py, 
### a quite useful and dumb idea that i make to access to installing software, drivers or more, like a rescue usb but after installing os.
#### Fun fact: this is the hard way using json to make choices.
### !!!!only for windows!!!!! because of the python-setup-file.bat checking code. just change it and it will compatible for another os.
